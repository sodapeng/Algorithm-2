#### week1: WordNet
* WordNet.java - A WordNet represented as a directed graph.
* SAP.java - Represents an immutable data type for shortest ancestral paths.
* Outcast.java - Identifies outcasts

#### week2: Seam Carving (Content-Aware Resizing)
* SeamCarver.java - Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time.
#### week3 Baseball Elimination
* BaseballElimination.java - We use maximum flow algorithms to solve the baseball elimination problem.

#### week4: Boogle
Boggle is a word game designed by Allan Turoff and distributed by Hasbro. It involves a board made up of 16 cubic dice, where each die has a letter printed on each of its sides. At the beginning of the game, the 16 dice are shaken and randomly distributed into a 4-by-4 tray, with only the top sides of the dice visible.
* BoggleBoard.java - Represents a Boggle board.
